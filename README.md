Review:

This article was organized and easy to read.  Article had examples of all 5 techniques. Examples and tutorials were good. It showed tuturial in step by step. It was easy to learn from article This article also had comparison of all five techniques. I really liked when they discussed about which one works best in different situations. I liked everything about this article. 
        
       
Everything was good in this article; however, i thought this article could be better if it discribed advanced version of 5 techniques. It will be better if they had video tuturial.
